This project uses SQL to analyze the bike store's sales, customer behavior, and inventory management. The key insights include:

- **Product Performance**: Top-selling products and categories.
- **Customer Orders**: Patterns in how customers purchase bikes, including peak sales periods and discount effectiveness.
- **Sales Trends**: Visualizing sales trends to make better stock and promotional decisions.
- **Customer Preferences**: Understanding what customers like to improve offerings.
- **Inventory Management**: Ensuring stock is available and efficiently distributed across stores.

### Conclusion:
Moderate discounts lead to increased sales without hurting profits
